# GAME PROTOTYPING PROJECT 1
User experience story prototypes
INTRODUCTION
It can be hard to imagine, but most of your favorite commercial games went through many stages of looking
not-so-great before they became the digital masterpieces you know and love. Prototypes – early, ugly
playable versions of games – are a key tool for designers to figure out if any of their ideas are any good!
Prototypes can take many forms, from tabletop versions of an eventual digital game to blocky 3D
environments with no artwork or textures called “grayboxes.” Learning how to “see” games in ways that are
not their compete forms is important so in this project, you will think about game levels from the player’s
mind.
PROJECT
Your first project for this course will be to reverse engineer a level from one of your favorite video games
into a text adventure. The recommended software for this is Twine (for which a tutorial video will be
provided), but you may use other tools if you wish (please understand that faculty may not be able to assist
in these situations if they don’t know the tool.) This will force you to think of your level as a set of spaces,
connections, and encounters, rather than a collection of 3D artworks.
Through this exercise, you will:
• Explore the concept of “gameplay narrative” – where you focus on the experience you want players
to have while interacting with your design.
• Practice iterative design through rigorous testing of your game
• Manage the iterative process with easily editable gameplay scenes
• Explore pacing, action, attention, and other elements that build interactive experience
• Have fun!
GAME REQUIREMENTS
Each student must create a playable non-digital game prototype. This consists of:
• Game can be for 1 or more players
• Game must be based on a level from a popular game. Do not only default to open world/exploratory
games – try building a level with less story and more combat, or a level from a retro game – think
about the decisions that players make moment to moment within a game!
• Games may not use non-public domain intellectual property (IP) – i.e. if your game mechanics are
based on Super Mario Bros., you must retheme it to be something you legally have the rights to 

User experience story prototypes
• Student should use each Twine/game scene to depict an encounter and a decision of some kind
(where to go, what to do, how to fight, etc.)
• Students must pay attention to the pacing of their scenes – do not skip low-action moments. Think
about what they are accomplishing as you recreate the chosen level (rest for the player, opportunity
to recover, visual reward etc.)
• Game must be playable for at least 5 minutes
• Variables may be used to develop deeper gameplay
• You may use screenshots of the original game to illustrate your scenes.
• ART/AESTHETICS DO NOT NEED TO BE FINAL
TEAM AND PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS
This is an project to be done in pairs – 2 designers per team. Designers will present their game to the class
on the Project 1 presentation date specified in the syllabus. Presentations requirements are:
• < 3 minute demonstration of basic gameplay
• Brief explanation of the video game your game is based on and how it is reflected in your design
• Brief discussion of the design (what went well, what didn’t go well, etc.)
• Q&A time with design critics
• LOOK NICE! – design presentations should be thought of as important events, smart or business
casual attire please.
Team members are responsible for dividing work evenly and resolving interpersonal issues. If issues with
team members persist, you may request a mediation session with the professor during office hours.
